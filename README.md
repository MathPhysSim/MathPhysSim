- 👋 Hi, I’m Simon
- 👀 I’m interested in state of the art methods for societal benefit, meaning there should be a real-world application.
- 🌱 I’m currently applying and learning many aspects of science as stochastic series, deep reinforcement learning and many more...leading a reinforcement learning team at the University in Salzburg. Before I spend several years at CERN.
- 💞️ I’m collaboration and look to collaborate on industry applications, accelerator physics, medical research and fundamendal research in general.
