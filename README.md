**Vice Director, IDA Lab | Head of Smart Analytics & Reinforcement Learning ([@SARL-PLUS](https://github.com/SARL-PLUS))** *Paris Lodron University of Salzburg (PLUS) | Visiting Scientist, CERN*

I am a Theoretical Physicist and Decision Scientist bridging the gap between rigorous theoretical modeling and modern Artificial Intelligence. My work integrates Hamiltonian mechanics, potential theory, and control theory with advanced machine learning to solve complex dynamical problems. 

In 2018, I led the first Deep Reinforcement Learning experiment at the CERN accelerator complex, establishing a foundational baseline for autonomous particle accelerator control. Today, I continue this mission to develop safe, uncertainty-aware RL agents for critical infrastructure, while aggressively pursuing technology transfer to industrial challenges.

### Core Expertise & Research Focus
* **Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Model-based and model-free RL algorithms (e.g., NAF, AE-DYNA) for continuous control and optimization tasks.
* **Physics & AI Integration:** Autonomous accelerator control, quantum control, and state-of-the-art computational methods.
* **Technology Transfer:** Applying high-precision RL control methods to industry domains, including smart energy grids, steel production, and medical robotics.

### Key Initiatives & Leadership
* **[SARL-PLUS](https://github.com/SARL-PLUS):** Leading the Reinforcement Learning and Data Science Team at the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Interfaces (AIHI).
* **[RL4AA](https://github.com/RL4AA):** Active contributor to the *Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Accelerators* international collaboration, fostering AI solutions for large-scale physics infrastructures.
* **Education & Outreach:** Organizer of the annual International Reinforcement Learning Bootcamp in Salzburg and speaker at TEDx ("AI is what we make it").

### Featured Open-Source Projects
* **[FERMI_RL_Paper](https://github.com/MathPhysSim/FERMI_RL_Paper):** Codebase utilizing model-based and model-free RL methods to solve particle accelerator operation problems at the FERMI Free-Electron Laser.
